# QUIC Java Client
*WORK IN PROGRESS, JUST EXPERIMENTING*

Based on the [wire specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WJvyZflAO2pq77yOLbp9NsGjC1CHetAXV8I0fQe-B_U/edit) and the [example server/client](https://www.chromium.org/quic/playing-with-quic) from the Chromium project, I'm trying to build a simple Java client. It's gonna be a rough ride...
